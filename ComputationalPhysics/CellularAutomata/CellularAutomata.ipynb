    "In physics, you have a *state* of the universe and you have some *rules to update* the state. In classical physics, the rules are always local (even in E&M, you can write things in terms of local fields).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your goal is to write down a model which captures these simple principles, cellular automata are the simplest way to do this.  In cellular automata you have a bunch of grid points (say on a square or a honeycomb) and you have some local rules to update these cells.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a lattice gas automata, you have two colors (black and white).  You can treat the black color as the gas and the white color as empty space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our *state*, then, is going to be where the gas and empty space is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the right half of the system filled with gas and the left half empty (i.e. the right half is black and the left half is white).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *rule* then is:\n",
    "* randomly select a site.\n",
    "* randomly select a neighbor.\n",
    "* swap the site and the neighbor (even if they are the same color).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you swap a white site with another white site you should count it as a time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use open boundary conditions (i.e. the top and the bottom don't wrap).  You have to be a bit careful about the boundaries. You don't want to access memory not in your array. \n",

    "Entropy is essentially a measure of how \"random\" a state is. The more random a state, the more entropy it should have.  A state where the \"gas\" is randomly placed is going to have the highest entropy.\n",
    "There are various ways then of measuring  entropy.  One approach is to take a configuration and ask how easy it is to compress it.  If it compresses efficiently then it has low entropy.  If it's completely \"random\"\n",
    "then it's hard to compress and has high entropy.  After you've produced configurations (in memory or as a file), go ahead and load the configuration using python, compress the state, and measure its size as a function of time.  This will be our heurestic for the entropy of the state (if a state is very disordered, it should be hard to describe compactly). You can use\n",
