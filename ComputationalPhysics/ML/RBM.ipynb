    "In this section, we will learn how to build and train a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to solve a simple engineering task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The restricted Boltzmann machine is an example of a physics-inspired method that is useful for engineering problems. At a high-level, RBMs are probability distributions for binary data with many tunable parameters. When \"training\" an RBM, we tune its parameters to make the RBM's probability distribution match the distribution of a training data set. Our goal in this unit is to make and train an RBM whose probability distribution matches the distribution of images in the MNIST handwritten digit data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a Hopfield network, a restricted Boltzmann machine is a particular type of Ising model. We saw that a Hopfield network can be thought of as a zero-temperature Ising model which equilibrates to a local energy minimum. Similarly, a restricted Boltzmann machine can be thought of as a finite-temperature Ising model with a particular connection structure between its spins. Because of their relation to statistical physics, RBMs are more interpretable than some other machine learning approaches. And because of their particular structure, they can be efficiently trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "A restricted Boltzmann machine is a probability distribution over binary variables, which, like in the Hopfield network, can be interpreted as spins or neurons. In an RBM, the binary variables are separated into two types, \"visible\" $v_i$ or \"hidden\" $h_j$ variables. The visible and hidden variables do not interact with variables of the same type, but only interact with variables of the other type. This special \"restricted\" structure allows us to separate the binary variables into two **layers**. Described using the language of statistical physics, an RBM is simply a Boltzmann distribution of an Ising model for the spins $v_i,h_j = \\pm 1$:\n",

Each entry of the weight matrix $W_{ij}$ describes an interaction between a visible spin $v_i$ and a hidden spin $h_j$. The visible bias $a_i$ (hidden bias $b_j$) is a magnetic field that encourages the visible spin $v_i$ (hidden spin $h_j$) to turn on. Note that the energy $E(v,h)$, and therefore the probability $p(v,h)$, depends on the weights $W_{ij}$ and biases $a_i, b_j$. These parameters define the RBM and are what we will tune during training.\n",

    "## Understanding Probability Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of probability distributions that we need to be familiar with to understand RBMs. These probabilities characterize the frequency with which we observe configurations of visible and hidden spins when sampling an RBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important is the **joint probability** $p(v,h)$. This is a probability distribution over multiple random variables that gives the probability of observing these variables simultaneously. In other words, it tells us probability that the visible spins are in configuration $v$ *and* the hidden spins are in configuration $h$. By definition, for an RBM, this is given by the Boltzmann distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(v,h)=\\frac{\\exp[-E(v,h)]}{\\sum_{v,h} \\exp[-E(v,h)]} \\equiv \\frac{\\exp[-E(v,h)]}{Z}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This probability distribution contains all of the information about how variables $v$ and $h$ are correlated with one another. The remaining probability distributions that we discuss are derived from the joint distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next are the **marginal probabilities** $p(v)$ and $p(h)$. These are probability distributions for subsystems of the entire system. Consider $p(v)$. Intuitively, $p(v)$ is the probability of observing the visible spin configuration $v$, averaged over all possible hidden spin configurations $h$. This quantity can be computed from the joint distribution $p(v) \\propto \\sum_h p(v,h)$, where the sum over $h$ is a sum over all $2^{N_h}$ spin confiurations of the hidden spins. So that this is a normalized probability distribution, with $\\sum_v p(v) = 1$, the marginal distribution for the visible spins is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "p(v) = \\frac{\\sum_h p(v,h)}{\\sum_{v,h} p(v,h)} = \\frac{\\sum_h \\exp[-E(v,h)]}{\\sum_{v,h} \\exp[-E(v,h)]}.\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we discuss the **conditional probabilities** $p(v|h)$ and $p(h|v)$, which are read as \"probability of $v$ given $h$\" and \"probability of $h$ given $v$\". These are a bit subtle, so take some time to think about them and how they relate to the other distributions. A conditional probability is a probability distribution of a subsystem conditioned on the complementary subsystem taking a specific value. Consider $p(v|h=\\hat{h})$. This is the probability that $v$ occurs given that $h$ is fixed to the value $\\hat{h}$. Like the marginal distribution, this probability can be computed from the joint distribution $p(v|h=\\hat{h}) \\propto p(v,h=\\hat{h})$. Notice that $p(v|h=\\hat{h})$ depends on two variables $v$ and $\\hat{h}$, but is only a probability distribution over the variable $v$. This means that it is only normalized over $v$ so that $\\sum_v p(v|h=\\hat{h})=1$ is true for any $\\hat{h}$. This leads us to the normalized definition of $p(v|h)$ (where we drop the $h=\\hat{h}$ notation) and its explicit form for an RBM\n",

    "Notice how closely related all of these probability distributions are. For example, the marginal and conditional probabilities are all directly related to the joint distribution $p(v,h)$, but have different normalizations, which dramatically affect their interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, joint, marginal, and conditional probability distributions are related by a simple formula. Suppose that we have a system split into subsystem $A$ and its complement $B$. The probability of $A$ *conditioned on* $B$, denoted by $p(A|B)$, relates to the marginal distribution of $B$ and the joint distribution of $A$ and $B$ via\n",

    "**Why are marginal and conditional probabilities important? Why did we not consider them in the Ising model unit?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables in an RBM are by design split into two groups, visible and hidden variables. When training an RBM, the visible variables are associated with data, such as the pixels in images, while the hidden variables are simply extra variables in the model, sometimes called auxiliary or latent variables. Because of the special interpretation of the visible variables, it is natural to consider the probability of just the visible spins, i.e., the marginal distribution $p(v)$. This marginal distribution is the probability distribution that we will want to match to a data set during training. This is why we care about marginal probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important technical detail about RBMs is that, because of the bipartite structure of the RBM, there is an efficient way to sample spin configurations using conditional probabilities $p(v|h)$ and $p(h|v)$. This efficient sampling allows us to perform efficient training. This is why we care about conditional probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Ising model unit, there was only one type of spin and there was no reason to split the spins into different subsystems. So we never needed to consider probability distributions that related different subsystems.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Building and Sampling an RBM\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first goal is to set up the basic code structure for your RBM. You will want to store the states of your visible and hidden variables, as well as the values of your parameters, the weight matrix and the biases. Note that the weight matrix is generally rectangular, as there may be different numbers of visible $N_v$ and hidden neurons $N_h$. You should also set up a function that computes the energy, which will be useful for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we want to learn how to sample configurations from our RBM, given the weights and biases, which we will need later in our training. Our goal is to produce spin configurations $(v,h)$ with probability $p(v,h)$. Since the RBM is just an Ising model, one way we could perform this sampling is by using Metropolis Markov Chain Monte Carlo as we did in the Ising model unit, where we performed single spin flips randomly by using the energy function. It turns out there is a more efficient sampling method for RBMs, because of their special restricted structure, that allows us to \"flip\" many spins at once instead of one-at-a-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficient Monte Carlo method that we will use to sample the joint distribution $p(v,h)$ is known as **Gibbs sampling**. Gibbs sampling involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given the current visible layer $v$, probabilistically choose a configuration for the hidden layer $h$.\n",
    "2. Given the chosen $h$, probabilistically choose a configuration for $v$.\n",
    "3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 $k$-times.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is a Markov chain, and therefore has a stationary distribution. To produce the desired distribution, we must probabilistically choose new configurations of the hidden or visible layers in such a way that the stationary distribution is proportional to $p(v,h) \\propto \\exp[-E(v,h)]$. This can be done by using conditional probabilities in each step of the sampling process. Specifically, the first two steps are:\n",
    "1. Given $v$, choose a new $h$ with probability $p(h|v)$.\n",
    "2. Given $h$, choose a new $v$ with probability $p(v|h)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1.** Because of the bipartite structure of the RBM, the conditional probability has a particularly nice, factorable form. For the hidden spins conditioned on the visible spins, it is\n",

    "\n",
    "Because $p(h|v)$ factors into a product of $p(h_j|v)$, the $h_j$ variables are distributed independently (for a given $v$) and we can sample them independently and at the same time. This is what makes Gibbs sampling efficient for RBMs. In practice, to sample $p(h|v)$, we go through each hidden neuron $h_j$ and choose to set it to $+1$ with probability $p(h_j=+1|v)=\\exp(m_j)/(\\exp(m_j) + \\exp(-m_j))$ and set it to $-1$ otherwise.\n",

    "\n",
    "The task that restricted Boltzmann machines are typically used for is **unsupervised learning**. The goal of unsupervised learning is to train a machine to learn the probability distribution underlying a data set. To accomplish this goal, the machine is trained on *unlabeled* data, such as raw images without any captions or identifying information. By training on a large enough data set of high quality samples, the machine will hopefully be able to learn the correlations in the data set. Ultimately, we would like the machine to be able to generalize from the data it has seen. A well-trained unsupervised learning model should be able to generate new data samples that have the same features as the original training data. For this reason, such models are often called *generative models*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your next big step is to train your RBM to learn a probability distribution, called the **data distribution**, from a data set of samples of the distribution, called the **training data**. During training, the RBM's parameters, the weights $W_{ij}$ and biases $a_i,b_j$, are tuned so that the marginal distribution of the visible spins $p(v)$ matches the data distribution represented by the training data set. After successful training, sampling the visible layer of your RBM should (ideally) produces new samples that are also from the same underlying distribution of the training data.\n",

Specifically, it starts at a particular point in the objective function's parameter space, computes the objective function's derivatives with respect to its parameters at that point, and then \"steps\" to a new point in the parameter space using the derivatives' values.

    "Currently we are sampling back and forth in the Gibbs sampling $k$-times.  This is called $CD_k$.  It is only in the large-k limit that we get the correct derivative (but in practice lower $k$ often works better because of cancellation of errors).    There is an alternative.  Instead of Gibbs-sampling back and forth $k$ times from the visible spins generated by data, for the second term in the derivative (step 4), we can sample back and forth from some other visible spins (`visible_step4`) that has nothing to do with the actual data.  We simply leave `visible_step4` wherever it was in the previous step.  This is somewhat more principled and is supposed to give better results but takes a lot longer to train (and you have to turn down the learning-rate).  This approach goes under the name persistent chains.

In practice, doing the averages over all $N$ samples gives us a really accurate estimate of the gradients, but is costly. In practice, we do not need such an accurate derivative. Therefore, we can average over smaller chunks, or \"mini-batches\", of the data. This is a tradeoff that results in lower accuracy but greater efficiency. In practice, what many people do is chose an arbitrary \"mini-batch size\" $M$, something like 100 that includes a statistically useful number of samples. The easiest way to make mini-batches is to first shuffle the entire data set and then separate the data into $N/M$ mini-batches so that $ x_1 $ through $x_M$ are in mini-batch 1, $x_{M+1}$ through $x_{2M}$ are in mini-batch 2, etc.  While you can write the loop over all the samples in the mini-batch, it is more efficient (especially in python) if you can compute the entire mini-batch with matrices (and no for-loops). *This will be very important (in python) if you're going to go on and do a MNIST or protein example below.* -->\n",

    "Finally, we will use our RBM code to tackle a more realistic and difficult engineering task: learning hand-written digits. After training, your RBM will have learned some general features of hand-written digits and be able to generate its own convincing drawings of numbers. In addition to being used as a generative model, a trained RBM can also be useful for anomaly detection, for example, checking if a particular image is likely to be from the data distribution or from another distribution. In our case, that means that $p(v_{digit}) \\gg p(v_{letter})$ for our RBM if $v_{digit}$ is an image of a hand-written digit and $v_{letter}$ is an image of a hand-written letter. RBMs can also be used as \"feature-detectors\" that supplement supervised learning methods in machine learning.\n",

    "The training data set that we will use to train our RBM is the MNIST database. The MNIST hand-written digit [database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a dataset of images and labels. Each image is a black-and-white picture of a hand-written number between $0$ and $9$. The label indicates which of these numbers the image corresponds to. Since we are doing *unsupervised learning*, we will ignore the labels and only use the images of the digits themselves as our training data set for the RBM.\n",

When you read in the MNIST data, divide everything by 256 to get things scaled between 0 and 1. Then apply a threshold of $0.5$ to all of the pixel values to convert them into binary numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to train your RBM on the MNIST data set. This will require some careful tuning of the algorithm parameters. Here are some suggested RBM parameters that you can use:\n",
    "* Initialize the weights $W_{ij}$ and the visible biases $a_i$ with random numbers from a uniform distribution between $-0.01$ and $0.01$. **Initialize the hidden biases $b_j$ to zero.** (It seems that the training can get stuck in a bad local minimum if you initialize the hidden biases to be too large.)\n",

If the training has converged, then the weights and biases will be not too large and will change very little at each step. If the training is failing, for example if the learning rate is too large, then the weights and biases might blow up and change dramatically at each step.\n",
    "* Train on a small piece of the entire dataset. For example, I used 5,000 samples from the MNIST dataset while testing. Then when you think things are working and you found good training parameters, rerun your calculations on the entire dataset.\n",
    "* Visualize the weights and biases. Since the visible spins $v_i$ form a 2D image, they can be relabeled as if they were on a 2D square grid $v_i \\rightarrow v_{(x,y)}$, where $(x,y)$ is a coordinate in the grid. Therefore, for a given hidden spin $h_j$, the weights connecting to the visible spins $W_{ij}$ can be reshaped into a matrix $W_{ij} \\rightarrow W^{j}_{(x,y)}$. These matrices can be visualized, say with `matplotlib.pyplot.matshow` in python. Visually, these weight matrices represent the correlations the hidden spins have with the visible spins. In a trained RBM, the weight matrices should look like \"features\" that contain elements of handwritten digits, such as straight and curved strokes. If your weights all look noisy or identical for all $j$, then probably the training is not working correctly.\n",
