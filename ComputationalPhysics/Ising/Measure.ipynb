    "A **phase** of matter (like gas, liquid, solid) can be defined by an order parameter (i.e. an observable) which is zero in one phase and not zero in another phase.  A 2D Ising model has two phases: the ferromagnet (essentially all spins up) and the paramagnet (essentially all random spins).  In the paramagnet, the squared magnetization is zero in the thermodynamic limit.  The ferromagnet, the squared magnetization is not zero in the thermodynamic limit.\n",

    "#### A note about errors\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of your Monte Carlo code as a black box that gives *correlated* samples of the magnetization. To get an average, do exactly what you're familiar with: sum the results then divide by the number of results. But further analysis involves subtleties that come with correlated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider estimating the error of the previously computed average. Given uncorrelated data, the error in the mean typically quantified by the **standard error**, $\\sigma_E \\equiv \\sigma / \\sqrt{N}$, where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation (ask python!) and $N$ is the number of datapoints. (Note: The standard deviation is essentially a measure of the spread of the data and has nothing to do with the amount of data points you have.) For correlated data, this is the wrong way to estimate error. In the correlated case you must divide the number of datapoints by a quantity called the **integrated autocorrelation time**, $\\tau$, to get the number of uncorrelated points.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose you've generated 100 samples of the Ising model with a MCMC method which has $\\tau = 4$. A non-zero value of $\\tau$ reflects the fact that movement from one configuration to another depends on where you start; here we need four moves to reach a configuration which is plausibly uncorrelated with the starting configuration. Thus, when analyzing the error of a mean, the number of uncorrelated samples in the calculation is a mere $100/4 = 25$ samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the standard error scaled by the autocorrelation time $\\tau$, you can use the [stats.py](stats.py) script. You can do this as follows\n",
