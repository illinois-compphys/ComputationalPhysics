    "Python is slow partially because it is not being compiled - i.e. it is an interpretive language.  One solution to this is to compile it. Unfortunately, it's difficult to compile everything that one can do in python.  That said, there are ways to compile functions that use a subset of python.  One tool that allows you to do that is [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)\n",

    "\n",
    "Three useful hints here:\n",
    "* There are some things that numba doesn't like to compile  - objects, named parameters in functions, etc.  If you try to run it and it complains that it is not happy compiling it, try to (1) change out the things it is unhappy about and (2) see if you can factor out the slow parts into smaller functions that don't do the disallowed things\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you're compiling a function, you probably also want to compile the functions it calls.  So generally I start by getting the innermost functions compiling and then work outwards from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The trick with optimization is to first get something working and then speed up the things that are slow.  Work one step at a time and don't worry about making everything fast.  Most things don't matter. "
