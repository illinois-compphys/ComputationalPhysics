    "## Minimal background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model was immortalized in physics history not by Ising, but by researchers who followed. In his original work (his PhD thesis, 1924), Ising considered only one-dimensional magnets and famously found that his namesake model did not describe a phase transition between paramagnetism and ferromagnetism, despite belief that it should. Interest in the model waned until 1936, when Rudolf Peierls argued that two-dimensional variants of the model *do* exhibit ferromagnetic phase transitions. In 1944, nearly a decade after Peierls' argument, Lars Onsager published an exact solution of the two-dimensional model &mdash; so crafty that its details still vex most physicists &mdash; validating Peierls' conclusions. Turns out the Ising model is a good model of ferromagnetism, but **dimensionality matters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently reliance on exact solutions is a poor method for identifying the interesting phases of models; we'd like to unpack more physics than two dimensions worth from a promising model over 20 years. It's for this reason that Ken Wilson's formulation of the **renormalization group** &mdash; following pioneering work by Gell-Mann and Low, Kadanoff, and undoubtedly many others &mdash; is held in such high regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The renormalization group (RG) is a theory of theories. Roughly speaking, it's a general method to determine how the physics of a particular model, expressed by a Hamiltonian $H$ involving a set of coupling constants $\\{ J_i\\}$, depends on dimensionality and (principally) *scale*. More concretely, it's a dynamical theory of the space of Hamiltonians. To make sense of RG we must step back and think broadly about how we write down physical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractly, we can imagine models as living in some infinite-dimensional space where the axes represent every conceivable interaction of the model's microscropic constituents. For magnetism models, one axis might be interaction with an external magnetic field, $\\mu B \\sum_i s_i$, another nearest-neighbor interactions, $J_1 \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} s_i s_j$, another next-nearest neighbor interactions, $J_2 \\sum_{\\text{n.n.n.}} s_i s_j$, many more for all four-moment interactions, $\\sum_{ijkl} K_{ijkl} s_i s_j s_k s_l$, and so on. To identify a concrete model, we merely specify values for the coupling constants $\\mu B$, $J_1$, $J_2$, $\\{ K_{ijkl} \\}$, etc., which parameterize the model's extension along each axis. Thus the plain Ising model lives along the $J_1$ (and sometimes $\\mu B$) axis, with all other coupling constants taken as 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcomes of measurements depend immensely on the scales at which they're taken, even when studying a single system. (Consider the results you might get measuring: the pressure of a balloon using its entire surface versus a square-angstrom patch; particles produced by 1eV proton collisions versus 10 TeV proton collisions.) Naively modeling, we would write down very different looking Hamiltonians to describe the physics at each scale. If it's truly possible to attribute one Hamiltonian to the microscopic stuff in a system, there must be some way to determine how that Hamiltonian evolves as the system is probed at different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "RG provides such a methodology by establishing differential equations for a model's coupling constants. Viewing coupling constants as functions of some observation scale (be it energy or length), it determines the significance of interactions as a system is examined at increasing/decreasing scale, showing how the constants grow or shrink.\n",
    "\n",
    "On this page we'll walk through a discrete, numerical application of RG to the Ising model. Iteratively transforming the model to larger and larger lattice sizes (lower and lower energies), we'll find that it describes multiple phases of matter at low energy."

    "The whole point of the renormalization group is that you should be able to apply the renormalization procedure over and over again and flow to a fixed point which corresponds to a phase.  We've already seen this in pictures when you coarse grained twice.  Now, we are going to see if we can use your $R(J)$ plot to see the same thing.  Suppose you start at $J=0.35$.  We can then ask what your new $J$ is after the first coarse graining step - it's $R(0.35)$.  Now, suppose we were to do the renormalization procedure again.  Well instead of starting at $0.35$ you would start at $R(0.35)$.  A nice way to see this graphically is to draw an arrow from $(0.35,R(0.35))$ to $(R(0.35),R(0.35))$.   You can do this using `pylab.pyplot.arrow(0.35, R(0.35), R(0.35)-0.35,0)`.  The arrow is now pointing at the new spot on the x-axis you would start.  And after you apply the RG step you'll actually be at $(R(0.35),R(R(0.35)))$.  Draw the arrow from $(R(0.35),R(0.35))$ to $(R(0.35),R(R(0.35)))$.  Now iterative the RG process a couple more times.
