    "The quantum piece of Shor's algorithm is period finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to doing period finding is doing phase estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In phase estimation we have a unitary matrix $U$ represented as a set of gates.\n",
    "* Unitary matrices have eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",
    "* The eigenvalues are always of the form $e^{2\\pi i\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in phase estimation will be to take an eigenvector $|\\Psi_j\\rangle$ of $U$ such that $U|\\Psi_j\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i\\theta_j}$ and get our quantum circuit to tell us $\\theta_j$\n",
    "$0\\leq \\theta < 1$.   \n",
    "This means that if the binary string we get is \"011\" that this is $(0 \\times 1/2) + (1 \\times 1/4) + (1 \\times 1/8)=3/8$.  Another way we can think of $\\theta_j$ is the binary number (i.e. 011 or 3) divided by the size of the Hilbert space, $2^\\textrm{number of top wires}$ (i.e $2^3=8$).  In our above example this also gives us 3/8.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume in this process that we have access to the gates which make up $U$ as well as a way to start in an eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will split up our wires into two parts:  the top (blue below) and bottom (red).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top we are going to put it $|0\\rangle$ and at the bottom we are going to put in $|\\Psi_j\\rangle$ so the total state is $|0\\rangle|\\Psi_j\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the circuit we want the top to be $|\\theta_j\\rangle$ and the bottom to still be $|\\Psi_j\\rangle$ so the total state is $|\\theta_j \\rangle |\\Psi_j \\rangle$.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just consider the case where the unitary circuit $U$ is just a single phase gate $P(\\phi)$.  First, notice that the eigenvalue of $P$ are $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ with eigenvalues $e^{i 0}$ and $e^{2\\pi i (\\phi/2\\pi)}$.  So $\\theta_0 = 0$ and $\\theta_1 = \\phi/(2\\pi)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of bottom wires then is going to be 1 (since our unitary $U$ only has one wire).  The number of top wires is going to depend how accurate we want to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only have one wire on the top then all we can say is that the phase $\\theta_j =\\phi/2\\pi$ is close to 0 or close to 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two wires on the top then we could get the binary numbers: $|00 \\rangle \\rightarrow 0$, $|01\\rangle \\rightarrow 1/4$ , $|10\\rangle \\rightarrow 1/2$ , $|11\\rangle \\rightarrow 3/4$.  So the best we could hope for is whether $\\theta_j$ is  close to $0,1/4,1/2$, or $3/4$.\n",
