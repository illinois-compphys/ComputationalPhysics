    "The first aspect of the brain that we will try to understand is memory. How does memory work? Roughly speaking, neurons somehow store sensational signals entering the brain as memories, then \"remember\" those memories by retrieving them when similar signals appear in the future.\n",

    "The Hopfield network, invented by the physicist John Hopfield, is a model of how neurons store and process memories. We will learn how to implement this model, teach it to memorize images, and recover images from its memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hopfield network is a particular artificial neural network. In general, a neural network is a graph with neurons at the vertices of the graph and edges connecting the neurons to one another. The edges of this graph can be directed or undirected. The Hopfield network in particular has undirected edges. The Hopfield network has a set of variables that define the model. Each neuron $i$ has a *state* $s_i$ that represents the level of activation of the neuron. Additionally, each neuron has a bias (or threshold) $b_i$ to activate and each edge has a weight $W_{ij}$ associated with it that indicates how likely neurons $i$ and $j$ are to activate together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hopfield network is a dynamical model. Its dynamics is governed by an update rule. At step $n$ in the dynamics, we choose a random neuron $i$ and update it state. The state of the $i$-th neuron in the network has $s^n_i$ is either -1 or 1. To decide on the new state at step $n+1$, we:\n",

We chose a spin at random and flipped it with a probability $\\min(1,e^{-\\Delta E/k_BT})$ that depended on the energy of the old and new spin configurations. When the temperature is zero ($T=0$), we only accept spin flips that decreased the energy. This $T=0$ Monte Carlo spin flip update is equivalent to the update rule of the Hopfield network.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a really nice implication of this analogy. First, notice that each update either decreases the energy or leaves it unchanged. This means that after enough updates you will eventually reach a configuration which is a *local* minimum in energy. At such a minimum, there are no further network updates to make; each attempted update step returns the same configuration. Consequently, for each input to a Hopfield network, there is a particular output to which the Hopfield network converges.\n",

    "## Building a Hopfield Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of this assignment is to write code to build a Hopfield Network. My recommendation is to take an object-oriented approach, making a Hopfield network class that keeps the states $s_i$ and biases $b_i$ of the $n$ neurons in two vectors and the weights $W_{ij}$ in an $n \\times n$ matrix. You will need a function that updates the state (chooses a random neuron and updates it according to the above update rule). You will also need a procedure to determine if the network has converged. One way to go about this is to loop through all the neurons and check if any of them want to change (but don't change them!). A function that computes the energy, as well as functions that set and return the state, are useful as well.\n",

    "\n",

Run your network through the update rule for a series of random initial states. Measure the energy of the initial states and their subsequent updates. Produce a graph, with lines for each run, plotting the energy versus update step. Show that the plots are monotonically non-increasing.
