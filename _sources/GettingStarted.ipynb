    "run your code in the cloud and want to use jupyter notebooks, you can use google colab.  If you want to work on an IDE and\n",
    "run it through the cloud, one option is repl.it (which has a free tier).  The environment there is nice but I'm not\n",
    "sure it's going to be fast enough to run the simulations we need to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python (on your machine through Anaconda)\n",
    "\n",
    "A convenient package of python libraries, which includes important modules like numpy, scipy, and matplotlib, is Anaconda. We recommend you install Anaconda on your machine, so that you have all these necessary packages. Make sure that you get the right version for your machine. Check if your machine is 32-bit or 64-bit and use the corresponding installer. **Please use python 3.xx** <!-- Also, make sure the version of Anaconda you get has python 2.7, which is the most commonly used version and should be the default. The newest version of python is python 3.6, but we do not recommend you use it.--> Python has two version (2.7 and 3.6).  For what we are doing it probably doesn't matter much which version you use but, all other things being equal, you should probably use the newer version (3.6) as this will be most useful to learn.\n",

    "#### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Anaconda for Linux, follow the instructions listed [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/linux).\n",

    "#### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Anaconda for Windows, follow the instructions listed [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/windows).\n",
    "<!-- You should probably read the C++ section of these notes before installing python to your local machine. You might prefer to simply ssh into an engineering workstation, which already has python installed, rather than installing python.-->\n",

    "g++ --version\n",

Another option is to install macports (where you can install more recent compilers, etc.)  See [here](https://www.macports.org/) if you want to do that (this is typically what I do on my macs).

    "sudo apt-get install [compiler name]\n",

    "#### SSH into the engineering workstations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to (or have trouble) installing things locally, one option is to \"SSH\" (secure shell) into the University-provided Linux engineering workstations. These are Linux machines that come with `gcc`, as well as `python`, already installed. To access these resources, you need to be able to ssh into `netid@linux.ews.illinois.edu`, where you replace `netid` with your specific University net ID.\n",

    "Another standard SSH program (for Windows) is PuTTY. You can download it [here](http://www.putty.org/). It is pretty straightforward to use, but just in case some installation and usage instructions can be found [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/install). When you login to `netid@linux.ews.illinois.edu`, you will be prompted to accept an SSH key and then you will need to enter a password.
