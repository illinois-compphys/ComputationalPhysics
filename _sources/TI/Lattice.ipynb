    "Our goal in this section is to start understanding solids.  Solids consist of atoms arranged in a periodic way.  So to understand solids we need to start by understanding periodic arangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with one-dimensional solids and then move to two-dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start by consider two different chains of Hydrogen atoms:\n",
    "* Hydrogen Chain: all the hydrogen atoms are the same distance apart.\n",
    "* Distorted Hydrogen Chain: the hydrogen atoms have distorted themselves so they are in pairs.  This is called a [Pierls Distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peierls_transition) and is a common thing for a 1d chain of atoms to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "![HChain](images/HChain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are a couple things to notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In a real solid, we should think of it essentially being infinitely long.  Our computers don't like to hold an infinite amount of information.  To best emulate this what we do is use periodic boundary conditions.  Assume we want to only hold six atoms.  Then we say that atom 6 is actually adjacent to atom 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  We see that there is a chunk of the material that can be translated by $\\vec{a_1}$ and you get back the same system. We call that chunk of material the *unit cell* and $\\vec{a_1}$ the lattice vector.  In the Hydrogen chain we see that the unit cell contains one Hydrogen atom and that $\\vec{a}_1=1$ unit in the $x$ direction.  In the distorted Hydrogen chain we see that the unit cell contains two Hydrogen atoms and that $\\vec{a}_1=2$ units in the $x$ direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The center of all our unit cells are at $m \\vec{a}_1$ where $m$ is an integer between 0 and $N$ (the number of unit cells).  This defines our real-space lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  We can specify the location of the atoms within the unit cell by saying how far it is displaced from the center of the unit cell.  For example, for the distorted Hydrogen lattice, this is $\\\\{ \\vec{\\tau}_0 = 0.0; \\vec{\\tau}_1 =0.8 \\\\}$  units in the $x$ direction. This set is called the basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Labeling our lattice sites:**  Now, we might want to label our hydrogen atoms.  We could label them by their position (i.e. the Hydrogen atom at spot 2.8) but that turns out to be less convenient then labeling them by (unit cell, atom number).  Then we can talk about the Hydrogen atom labelled (3,b) which is the \"b\" Hydrogen atom in the 3rd unit cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both the Hydrogen and distorted Hydrogen lattice, write a function\n",
    "`def Labels(N)`\n",
    "which takes the number of unit cells and returns a list of site labels.  (i.e. `myLabels = Labels(3)` should return the list `[(1,a),(1,b),(2,a),(2,b),(3,a),(3,b)]` for the distorted Hydrogen lattice)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, each lattice site has three things:  a label, a location, and an index (i.e. which spot on the list it's in).\n",
    "It will be useful to have functions which convert between these. Write python functions (for both lattices):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `LabelToR(myLabel)`  Let the (1,1) atom be at location 0. For the distorted Hydrogen chain, LabelToR( (2,b)) should return 2.8\n",
    "* `LabelToIndex(myLabel)`\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "In addition, we are going to want to be able to figure out neighbors. Let's right a python function (for both lattices)\n",
    "* `MyNearestNeighbors(myLabel)` which returns a list of the labels of your nearest neighbors\n",

    "#### Momentum Space\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a real space lattice of unit cells each of which contain some number of types of atoms.  We can also have a momentum space lattice (called the reciprocal lattice) again each of which contains some number of types of atoms (so 2 in the distorted Hydrogen lattice)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reciprocal lattice is defined (in 1d) as $m\\vec{b}_i$ where\n",
    "$0\\leq m < N$ is an integer where $N$ is the number of unit cells and $\\vec{b}_1=2\\pi/(N|\\vec{a}_1|)$  (the key property that $\\vec{b}$ must obey is that $\\vec{b}_1 \\cdot N\\vec{a}_1 = 2\\pi$).  We will have a list of labels that consist of $(m, \\textrm{ atom type})$.\n",

The vector $\\vec{\\tau}_1=(0,1/\\sqrt{3})$ connects an \"a\" site to a \"b\" site in the same unit cell.\n",

    "**Labeling our lattice sites:**  Again, we'd like to label our lattice sites.  It will still be convenient to label them by the unit cell and then the atom within that unit cell. Now, to label the unit cell it's easiest to use two numbers $(p,q)$ which tells us that the unit cell we are talking about is $p$ unit cells in the $\\vec{a}_1$ direction and $q$ unit cells in the $\\vec{a}_2$ direction. We can then use an additional number to say which atom within the unit cell it is.\n",
